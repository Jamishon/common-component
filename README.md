#    Common components used as wheels in development projects

  I'm an application coder for many years, coding on platforms like  
Windows, Android, Solari. We are completing requirements faster and  
more completely, we call various APIs, but we don't know what the  
actually does under surface.  
  Someone said you should keep the ability to build the wheel, but  
better not build it in your daily work, I quietly ask myself:â€œDid  
I really have the ability to build wheels ?" , actually I don't.  
  So I have to implement the wheels we used in our daily work, one  
by one, step by step, maybe not efficient and perfect, but I  
make it runable at first.
